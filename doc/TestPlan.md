## introduction

The test plan is based on the [test strategy](\ref TestStrategy), which it
translates into concrete test scenarios and time lines. While the test strategy
usually is changing only slightly from release to release (representing the 
learning process of the team and changing requirements and environments during
developement), the test plan usually changes significantly per release, as 
new requirements are implemented or old requirements are signed off.
